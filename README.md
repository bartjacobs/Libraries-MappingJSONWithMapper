### Mapping JSON With Swift and Mapper

#### Author: Bart Jacobs

A few weeks ago, I [wrote about Unbox](https://cocoacasts.com/unboxing-json-with-swift-and-unbox/), a lightweight library to convert JSON data to model objects. There is a lot to like about Unbox and it takes seconds to start using it in a project.

I recently came across [Mapper](https://github.com/lyft/mapper), a similar library that is developed and maintained by the people at [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/). The feature set of Mapper is very similar to that of Unbox. That is not surprising, though. Both libraries aim to solve the same problem, converting JSON data to strongly typed model objects.

In this tutorial, I refactor the weather application I created for Unbox, replacing Unbox with Mapper.
